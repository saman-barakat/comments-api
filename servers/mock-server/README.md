# Mock Server for OpenAPI

From [https://github.com/muonsoft/openapi-mock/](https://github.com/muonsoft/openapi-mock/)

This directory contains a prebuilt mock-server v0.3.2 from [openapi-mock/releases](https://github.com/muonsoft/openapi-mock/releases).

To start the server run:

`./servers/mock-server/openapi-mock serve --specification-url schema/comments-schema.yaml`

Which would begin service the spec on `http://localhost:8080`
