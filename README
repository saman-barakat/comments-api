### Batch generate by running:

Why No to Bazel?
Given that this project touches multiple languages and platform, there is the strong allure to use a platform agnostic build system.
- Poor tooling support
- High cost of initial setup given need for MVP
- Worth revisiting in a year time.

Why No to Protos?
Protos would help avoid/minimize language-specific ideosyncrasies in the implementation and usage of the models.
- Very poor tooling support.
- Poor to no support for critical OpenAPI features like security.
